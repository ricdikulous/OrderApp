#Order App
A project that is composed of an Android application and a website that is intended to be
used by a new restaurant focussed on deliveries. The restaurant has not yet launched but
much of the application is completed. The app allows users to browse the menu, place
orders, pay with paypal and then receive updates of their orderâ€™s progress.<br> 
The backend is a website that contains a content management system that allows browsing/editing 
of the menu and browsing/progressing the current orders<br>
